<h1>The Best Movies According To Evan </h1>
<h2>My top 5 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>The idea behind this movie is really good. I enjoy the plot and the original soundtrack</p>
<h3>Tresure Planet</h3>
<p>This was my childhood favorite movie because I enjoyed the imagination behind it. The characters are well written for a Disney movie!</p>
<h3>Tron Legacy</h3>
<p>I know I probably should enjoy the original more than the sequal but I enjoy the more modern films.</p>
<h3>Spider-Man Into The Spider-Verse</h3>
<p>Great movie overall, its nice to have a different Spider-Man other than Peter Parker. The story was fantastic and the soundtrack was also good.</p>
<h3>Ready Player One</h3>
<p>Just like gamers had their favorite movies from back in the day, I believe this will be the one for modern times. </p>
